Who did what? Names should be on your section of the schedule.
Requirements - Durations should not have ?, and they should be longer than 2 days. We also do not need 2 resources working on two days worth of work. There's no mention of event in the SOW, so I'm not sure where your information is coming from. General flow of requirements gathering is fine: gather requirements, review, fix, signoff. Wirefames logic is ok, but you did not include the 3 iterations to modify wireframes. App map logic is off, and it does not align with your "event" requirements. Overall, you're not too far off; you just need to read the SOW and align your project to it.

Architecture - You did not follow the SOW whatsoever. I don't know where any of this information is coming from. This is not a reflection of what was taught in class. Basically every task has an over allocated resource, which should never happen. You have way too many resources working on the same task, and PM should only appear on line 3. This needs so much work. Step 1 would be to look at the SOW and actually create architecture based off of what's in the scope to deliver.

Coding - This is too generic. It is not specific to your project nor the SOW. Your resources name aren't correct, and you're missing predecessors. Durations should not be 1 or 2 days for tasks that are not reviews. You're missing System Testing and Code Package for Testing. Your effort was bare minimum overall.

Testing - This is too generic. It is not specific to your project nor the SOW. Your resources name are missing or incorrect, and you're missing predecessors. Tasks should not be manually scheduled. Durations should not be 1 or 2 days for tasks that are not reviews. It does not look like we tried.

Deployment -
Same comments for coding and testing apply. Where's the effort?

Req is good in theory, just not aligned to the SOW. There is no Event anything in the scope. -12
Arch and coding has nothing to do with the SOW, primarily (not matching scope) - 12
Testing is the same -- I see Registration and login -- not really called out in the main parts of the scope -- all the other stuff is basically not in the scope. -12
No idea what Deployment represents -- show me anything in the scope that aligns.

This is in your SOW, WBS must somewhat align..
Key Functionalities:
● User Authentication: Secure login and registration for McKesson buyers and verified suppliers.
● User Profiles: Buyers can create profiles, track bids, and manage watchlists. Sellers can list medical supplies for auction, upload pictures, set starting bids, and define auction duration.
● Auction Listing & Management: Create auction listings with detailed medical supply descriptions, images, and specifications. Set minimum bid amounts and reserve prices. Automated auction closing when time expires.
● Real-Time Bidding System: Live updates on bids. Email and push notifications for bid updates and auction status.
● Compliance Verification: Ensure all suppliers meet regulatory and compliance standards for medical supplies.
● Payment Processing: Secure payment gateway for transactions. Multiple payment methods (Credit/Debit Card, Digital Wallets). Secure escrow system to protect transactions.
● Transaction & Order History: Users can view their past bids and auction history. Sellers can see completed and pending transactions.
● Rating & Reviews: Buyers can rate suppliers and provide feedback after transactions.
● Admin Dashboard: Manage user accounts, auction listings, and transaction reports. Fraud detection and user verification features.

Out of Scope
● Auction Services for Non-Registered Users – Only registered McKesson users and verified medical suppliers can participate in bidding.
● Physical Storage & Delivery of Medical Supplies – The platform only facilitates transactions; logistics and delivery are the responsibility of suppliers.
● Advanced AI-based Bidding Algorithms – Automated smart bidding features may be considered in future updates.
● Third-Party Background Checks – No external verification of users beyond basic account authentication.
● Customer Support Services – The project will not include 24/7 customer support; only FAQs and automated responses will be available.

Date on 1st page is not correct.
KA's is ok. PA's needs lots of work, MMs need lots of work. Financials are not correct.
-5 for this section

Risks
- None of your risks follow the structure discussed in class
- Several of your risks are missing contingencies (Kailong -3)
- R3: Bold headers cannot be a task in your risk. (Manny -1)
- Majority of your tasks do not align with tasks on the MPP (Kailong -5)
-5 for this section

Actions
- We should not have a K1, K2, or M1, and M1. It should be A1 through A6.
- A1 is not good. No mention of event in scope
- A2 is a no. It's a given for req lead to identify requirements - that's the job
- All of these actions need work.
-1 for this section

Decisions
- D1 is okay. The others need work. (No points reduced)

Overview should be much more specific and show a flow from working teams to leadership.
This is not really usable, missing so much. The Stakeholder table did not get updated and alignment is off. This is not a good GT.

Why are Req and Arch wording so similar???
This is not learning the real reason. This is generic -- are y'all in this class?
Why is the order all off??
Coding the difference is tight deadlines??? How?? Software purchase?? You cannot just make up stuff.
Testing at least tried.
Price of Servers was never in your costs.

This is really not good. I have no idea who did what. -7 for everyone.
